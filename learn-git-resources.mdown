# Resources for Learning (& Using) Git & Github

## Getting Setup

- [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book/ch1-4.html) chapter 1.4 covers installing git on Linux, Mac, & Windows
- StackOverflow's [How to Install Git](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/315911/git-for-beginners-the-definitive-practical-guide#323764) covers all the major operating systems and installation methods

## Learn Git

- ACRL TechConnect's "[Gentle Introduction to Modern Version Control](http://acrl.ala.org/techconnect/?p=1191)" by John Fink is a good starting point for understanding version control (the type of software Git is)
- [OpenHatch](https://openhatch.org) has a _great_ "training mission" on [using git](https://openhatch.org/missions/git)
- [Learning Git](https://speakerdeck.com/bitsandbooks/learning-git) presentation by Rob Dumas
- Code School's [Try Git](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git) course (looks like a few lessons are free, later ones are paid?). They also have a [Git Real](http://gitreal.codeschool.com/) course, difference between them is unclear.
- [Git for Beginners (and Dropbox Users)](http://blog.hackersatberkeley.com/?p=151) by the Hackers@Berkeley blog gives a thorough walk-through of the first steps for using Git & Github

## Learn Github

- [Github's Help dox](https://help.github.com/) are pretty good.
- [learn.github.com](learn.github.com) has an overwhelming amount of material, perhaps too much to be useful
- [How to Github](How to GitHub: Fork, Branch, Track, Squash and Pull Request) is a thorough walk-through of contributing to someone else's project on Github chock full of best practices like using a development branch & "squashing" commits using `git rebase`
- [Let's Suck at Github Together](http://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/101-lets-suck-at-github-together/) is a screencast by Chris Coyier (of [CSS-Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/)) showing the basics of git(hub) using the [Tower](http://www.git-tower.com/) app
- [Let's Attempt to do a Pull Request](http://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/117-lets-attempt-to-do-a-pull-request/) is another screencast by Coyier. There's a lot of time spent wandering around lost but you do get to see the fundamentals of a pull request.

## Git Reference & Books

- [Git Reference](http://gitref.org/) documents various commands & options
- [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book), a book about Git that's more accessible than its title makes it sound
- [Git for beginners: the definitive practical guide](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/315911/git-for-beginners-the-definitive-practical-guide) on StackOverFlow is less of a guide than a collection of StackOverflow links but it does answer many, many questions

## Git GUIs

Graphical software that lets you use Git without the command line.

- [Github for Mac](http://mac.github.com/)
- [Github for Windows](http://windows.github.com/)
- [Tower](http://www.git-tower.com/)

There is [a list of GUIs](http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) available on the official Git website. They point to [an even more extensive list](https://delicious.com/matthew.mccullough/git+gui) on Delicious.
