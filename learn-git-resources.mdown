# Resources for Learning (& Using) Git & Github

## Getting Setup

- [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book/ch1-4.html) chapter 1.4 covers installing git on Linux, Mac, & Windows
- StackOverflow's [How to Install Git](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/315911/git-for-beginners-the-definitive-practical-guide#323764) covers all the major operating systems and installation methods

## Learn Git

- ACRL TechConnect's "[Gentle Introduction to Modern Version Control](http://acrl.ala.org/techconnect/?p=1191)" by John Fink is a good starting point for understanding version control (the type of software Git is)
- [OpenHatch](https://openhatch.org) has a _great_ "training mission" on [using git](https://openhatch.org/missions/git)
- [Git Ready](http://gitready.com) is a nice set of command explanations, categorized "beginner," "intermediate," and "advanced"
- Code School's [Try Git](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git) course (looks like a few lessons are free, later ones are paid?).
- [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/lab_01.html) has a step-by-step tutorial that takes you from set-up to managing multiple repositories rather quickly.
- Once you have some commands under your belt, the [Git Cheat Sheet](http://byte.kde.org/~zrusin/git/git-cheat-sheet-medium.png) is a good place to go to learn more

## Learn GitHub

- [GitHub's Help dox](https://help.github.com/) are pretty good.
- [How to GitHub: Fork, Branch, Track, Squash and Pull Request](https://gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request/) is a thorough walk-through of contributing to someone else's project on Github chock full of best practices like using a development branch & "squashing" commits using `git rebase`

## Learn the Command Line

While not required knowledge to use git (see the Git GUIs below), a basic familiarity with the command line is useful in using Git and understanding what's going on.

- [Command Line Basics Series](http://drupalize.me/series/command-line-basics-series) by Lullabot, a team of [Drupal](http://drupal.org) experts

## Git Reference & Books

- [Git Reference](http://gitref.org/) documents various commands & options
- [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book), a book about Git that's more accessible than its title makes it sound

## Git GUIs

Graphical software that lets you use Git without the command line.

- [GitHub for Mac](http://mac.github.com/)
- [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com/)
- [Tower](http://www.git-tower.com/)

There is [a list of GUIs](http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) available on the official Git website.
